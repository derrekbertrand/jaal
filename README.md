## About JAAL

JAAL is a "JSON:API Abstraction for [Laravel][laravel]". It is **not** framework agnostic, and is **not** an
un-opinionated solution.

### Installation

Currently, there is no packagist package. The library is not stable.

You can, however, [use this method](https://lornajane.net/posts/2014/use-a-github-branch-as-a-composer-dependency) if
you want to give it a go.


### Design Philosophy

- Declarative, fluent, and container-aware is what the library should strive to be
- Self-documenting code is good, documentation is great, examples are amazing, just working is paramount
- Boilerplate is just code where configuration should be, but just to be safe, our configuration is code
